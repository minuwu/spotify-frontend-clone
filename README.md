# [Spotify Frontend Clone](https://minuwu.github.io/spotify-frontend-clone/)

## Description

This project is a **frontend-only Spotify web UI clone**, built using **HTML and CSS** with no backend functionality. The interface recreates Spotifyâ€™s modern design, including a fixed sidebar for navigation, a scrollable main content area, and a sticky bottom music player. Components include a **navigation menu with icons**, a **library section with call-to-action boxes**, **trending playlists/cards**, and a **fully styled media player** with controls and a volume slider. The design uses **Font Awesome icons**, custom fonts, hover states, and responsive adjustments for smaller screens to provide a clean and interactive user experience.
